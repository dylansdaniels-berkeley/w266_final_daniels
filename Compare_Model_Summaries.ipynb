Through interactions with membrane potential, ion channels both control metabolic events and mediate cell communication. Consequentially, membrane bioelectricity bears on fields ranging from cancer etiology to computational neuro-science. Conductance models have proven successful in quantitatively capturing these dynamics but are often considered difficult, with interpretation relegated to specialists. To facilitate research in membrane dynamics, especially in fields where roles for ion channels are just beginning to be quantified, we must make these models easy to understand.\\nHere, we show that the membrane differential equation central to conductance models can be understood using simple circular geometry. The membrane state diagrams we construct are compact, faithful representations of conductance model state, designed to look like circular \\u201ccells\\u201d with currents flowing in and out. Every feature of a membrane state diagram corresponds to a physiological variable, so that insight taken from a diagram can be translated back to the underlying model. The construction is elementary: we convert conductances to angles subtended on the circle and potentials to radii; currents are then areas of the enclosed annular sectors.\\nOur method clarifies a powerful but prohibitive modeling approach and has the potential for widespread use in both electrophysiological research and pedagogy. We illustrate how membrane state diagrams can augment traditional methods in the stability analysis of voltage equilibria and in depicting the Hodgkin-Huxley action potential, and we use the diagrams to infer the possibility of nontrivial fixed-voltage channel population dynamics by visual inspection rather than linear algebra.\",\n          \"Beta frequency oscillations (15-29Hz) are among the most prominent signatures of brain activity. Beta power is predictive of many healthy and abnormal behaviors, including perception, attention and motor action. Recent evidence shows that in non-averaged signals, beta can emerge as transient high-power \\u201cevents\\u201d. As such, functionally relevant differences in averaged power across time and trials can reflect accumulated changes in the number, power, duration, and/or frequency span of the events. We show for the first time that functionally relevant differences in averaged prestimulus beta power in human sensory neocortex reflects a difference in the number of high-power beta events per trial, i.e., the rate of events. Further, high power beta events close to the time of the stimulus were more likely to impair perception. This result is consistent across detection and attention tasks in human magnetoencephalography (MEG) and is conserved in local field potential (LFP) recordings of mice performing a detection task. Our findings suggest transient brain rhythms are best viewed as a \\u201crate metric\\u201d in their impact on function, and provides a new framework for understanding and manipulating functionally relevant rhythmic events.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"base_bart_model\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" membrane bioelectricity bears on fields ranging from cancer etiology to computational neuro-science.

We used the Human Neocortical Neurosolver(HNN)\\u2019s biophysical model of a canonical neocortical circuit under exogenous thalamic and cortical drive to simulate the cell and circuit mechanisms underpinning the P2, N2, and P3 features of the FC-ERP observed after Stop-Signals in the Stop-Signal task (SST). We demonstrate that a sequence of simulated external thalamocortical and cortico-cortical drives can produce the FC-ERP, similar to what has been shown for primary sensory cortices. We used this model of the FC-ERP to examine likely circuit-mechanisms underlying FC-ERP features that distinguish between successful and failed action-stopping. We also tested their adherence to the predictions of the horse-race model of the SST, with specific hypotheses motivated by theoretical links between the P3 and Stop process. These simulations revealed that a difference in P3 onset between successful and failed Stops is most likely due to a later arrival of thalamocortical drive in failed Stops, rather than, for example, a difference in effective strength of the input. In contrast, the same model predicted that early thalamocortical drives underpinning the P2 and N2 differed in both strength and timing across stopping accuracy conditions. Overall, this model generates novel testable predictions of the thalamocortical dynamics underlying FC-ERP generation during action-stopping. Moreover, it provides a detailed cellular and circuit-level interpretation that supports links between these macroscale signatures and predictions of the behavioral race model.\\nSignificance statement The frontocentral event-related potential (FC-ERP) is an easily-measurable neural correlate of cognition and control. However, the cortical dynamics that produce this signature in humans are complex, limiting the ability of researchers to make predictions about its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we used the biophysical model included in the open-source Human Neocortical Neurosolver software to simulate and evaluate the likely cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie the FC-ERP in the Stop-Signal task. We modeled mechanisms of the FC-ERP during successful and unsuccessful stopping, generating testable predictions regarding Stop-associated computations in human frontal cortex. Moreover, the resulting model parameters provide a starting point for simulating mechanisms of the FC-ERP and other frontal scalp EEG signatures in other task conditions and contexts.\",\n          \"Magneto- and/or electro-encephalography (M/EEG) are non-invasive clinically-relevant tools that have long been used to measure electromagnetic fields in somatosensory cortex evoked by innocuous and noxious somatosensory stimuli. Two commonly applied stimulation paradigms that produce distinct responses in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) linked to innocuous and noxious sensations are electrical median nerve (MN) stimulation and cutaneous laser-evoked (LE) stimulation to the dorsum of the hand, respectively. Despite their prevalence, the physiological mechanisms that produce stereotypic macroscale MN and LE responses have yet to be fully articulated, limiting their utility in understanding brain dynamics associated with non-painful and/or painful somatosensation. Through a literature review, we detailed features of MN and LE responses source-localized to SI that are robust and reproducible across studies. We showed that the first peak in the MN response at \\u223c20 ms post-stimulus (i.e., MN N1) corresponds to outward-directed deep-to-superficial electrical current flow through the cortical laminae, which is followed by inward-directed current at \\u223c30 ms (i.e., MN P1). In contrast, the initial LE response occurs later at \\u223c170 ms (i.e., LE N1) and is oriented inward and opposite the direction of the MN N1. We then examined the neocortical circuit mechanisms contributing to the robust features of each response using the Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN) neural modeling software tool (Neymotin et al., 2020). Using HNN as a hypothesis development and testing tool, model results predicted the MN response can be simulated with a sequence of layer specific thalamocortical and cortico-cortical synaptic drive similar to that previously reported for tactile evoked responses (Jones et al., 2007; Neymotin et al., 2020), with the novel discovery that an early excitatory input to supragranular layers at \\u223c30 ms is an essential mechanism contributing to the inward current flow of the MN P1. Model results further predicted that the initial \\u223c170 ms inward current flow of the LE N1 was generated by a burst of repetitive gamma-frequency (\\u223c40 Hz) excitatory synaptic drive to supragranular layers, consistent with prior reports of LE gamma-frequency activity. These results make novel and detailed multiscale predictions about the dynamic laminar circuit mechanisms underlying temporal and spectral features of MN and LE responses in SI and can guide further investigations in follow-up studies. Ultimately, these findings may help with the development of targeted therapeutics for pathological somatosensation, such as somatic sensitivity and acute neuropathic pain.\",\n          \"Transient neocortical events with high spectral power in the 15\\u201329Hz beta band are among the most reliable predictors of sensory perception. Prestimulus beta event rates in primary somatosensory cortex correlate with sensory suppression, most effectively 100\\u2013300ms before stimulus onset. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this perceptual association are unknown. We combined human magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurements with biophysical neural modeling to test potential cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie observed correlations between prestimulus beta events and tactile detection. Extending prior studies, we found that simulated bursts from higher-order, non-lemniscal thalamus were sufficient to drive beta event generation and to recruit slow supragranular inhibition acting on a 300ms time scale to suppress sensory information. Further analysis showed that the same beta generating mechanism can lead to facilitated perception for a brief period when beta events occur simultaneously with tactile stimulation before inhibition is recruited. These findings were supported by close agreement between model-derived predictions and empirical MEG data. The post-event suppressive mechanism explains an array of studies that associate beta with decreased processing, while the during-event faciliatory mechanism may demand a reinterpretation of the role of beta events in the context of coincident timing.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"base_bart_model\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 188,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" conductance models have proven successful in quantitatively capturing dynamics but are often considered difficult, with interpretation relegated to specialists.

Through interactions with membrane potential, ion channels both control metabolic events and mediate cell communication. Consequentially, membrane bioelectricity bears on fields ranging from cancer etiology to computational neuro-science. Conductance models have proven successful in quantitatively capturing these dynamics but are often considered difficult, with interpretation relegated to specialists. To facilitate research in membrane dynamics, especially in fields where roles for ion channels are just beginning to be quantified, we must make these models easy to understand.\\nHere, we show that the membrane differential equation central to conductance models can be understood using simple circular geometry. The membrane state diagrams we construct are compact, faithful representations of conductance model state, designed to look like circular \\u201ccells\\u201d with currents flowing in and out. Every feature of a membrane state diagram corresponds to a physiological variable, so that insight taken from a diagram can be translated back to the underlying model. The construction is elementary: we convert conductances to angles subtended on the circle and potentials to radii; currents are then areas of the enclosed annular sectors.\\nOur method clarifies a powerful but prohibitive modeling approach and has the potential for widespread use in both electrophysiological research and pedagogy. We illustrate how membrane state diagrams can augment traditional methods in the stability analysis of voltage equilibria and in depicting the Hodgkin-Huxley action potential, and we use the diagrams to infer the possibility of nontrivial fixed-voltage channel population dynamics by visual inspection rather than linear algebra.\",\n          \"Beta frequency oscillations (15-29Hz) are among the most prominent signatures of brain activity. Beta power is predictive of many healthy and abnormal behaviors, including perception, attention and motor action. Recent evidence shows that in non-averaged signals, beta can emerge as transient high-power \\u201cevents\\u201d. As such, functionally relevant differences in averaged power across time and trials can reflect accumulated changes in the number, power, duration, and/or frequency span of the events. We show for the first time that functionally relevant differences in averaged prestimulus beta power in human sensory neocortex reflects a difference in the number of high-power beta events per trial, i.e., the rate of events. Further, high power beta events close to the time of the stimulus were more likely to impair perception. This result is consistent across detection and attention tasks in human magnetoencephalography (MEG) and is conserved in local field potential (LFP) recordings of mice performing a detection task. Our findings suggest transient brain rhythms are best viewed as a \\u201crate metric\\u201d in their impact on function, and provides a new framework for understanding and manipulating functionally relevant rhythmic events.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"base_bart_model\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" membrane bioelectricity bears on fields ranging from cancer etiology to computational neuro-science.
